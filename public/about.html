<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I worked as a programmer in the late 90s, programming in dBASE for a local O&G consulting company and eventually transitioning into desktop/server support. 
  My first love has always been programming, taking an idea and seeing it through to the completed product. As a avid golfer,
  I created programs in dBASE and Pascal to track golf stats. 

<p>I regret going away from programming and missed it over the years. I have decided to jump into the realm of Web Development to facilitate the development of my next project ideas.</p>
